1. We need to create a file listing all the stocks we want to use.
1.1 The file should be in the format "SYMBOL     NAME".
2. use download_all.py to download all the portfolios from NYSE.txt/
2.1 download_all uses download_spreadshit_yahoo.py to download each portfolio at a time.
2.2 download_all downloads to the running path by default.
3. now we need to find the extremum values.
3.1 use find_min_max.py.
3.2 use the for_all_stocks_do.py to run find_min_max on each .csv file.
3.3 if the .csv file contains an error due to inavalability to download the data,
    "not valid" would be printed for that file.
3.4 If you gather the output of procedure 3, you get the list of invalid stocks.
4. find_invalid.py is used to gather into one file only the invalid linse.
