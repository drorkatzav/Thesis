1. Open Websites:
I looked all over the web for good sites for portfolio downloading..
I found some, including Yahoo!Finance, and the following:
- http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3AAA&fstype=ii&ei=HJCeUNDcEOr6wAPOOA
- http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm
- http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=aa
Several Israely websites that do not allow you to download NYSE potfolios.

2. WRDS:
Than the university connected me to the WRDS database. There I could download a huge portfolio
with tousands of lines. I used scripts inorder to split it into few files, one for each symbol.

Some Library DBs but none of them sufficient.

3. Scripts:
3.1. Download portfolios - I used a script inorder to download all the downloadable data from yahoo!,
mostly the dayly value for each day.
3.2. Work with those portfolios - I used few scripts inorder to find the etremum values for each symbol and merge them
into one csv file. Scripts can be found here: /home/dror/Projects/thesis
3.3. Work with WRDS -  I tried to find extremum values for each collomn altough I do not know what is the meaning of
the collomns... I appended them into one csv with only extremum values.
3.3.1 The scripts can be found here: /home/dror/Projects/thesis/WRDS/scripts/

4. NeuralNetwork Software: 
Now I tried to download various posabilities for building the neural network.
SciPy - I downloaded the necessarry packages for running SciPy (and Numpy).
MATLAB - Still looking for a license for MATLAB
SPSS - 
Other - 

5. Algorithm:
